NodeJs, yarn, express, MDB React, and mongo.
You can go to nodeJs' web site and dowload the installer: https://nodejs.org/es/
Be sure to select the install npm option and the addToPATH option during the installation process.

Secondly, install mongoDB in your local environment. Follow the instructions on the link below to get it:

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

I stongly recommend the use of yarn, because it makes the use of the React front-end easier. To install it use:
```
$ npm install -g yarn
